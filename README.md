# Elfos-dzx1

This is a utility for Elf/OS that decompresses ZX1 files. The ZX1 compression algorithm, by Einar Saukas is designed to be small and fast on 8-bit processors and so is well-suited for the 1802 and Elf/OS.

At this time, there is no native 1802 compressor since the algorithm for optimal compression is a little complex and resource-intensive, however this will decode compressed files created by the C compressor here:
